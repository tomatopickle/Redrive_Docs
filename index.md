## How it works

Redrive works by connecting your local storage (called a Drive) with your internet connected devices


## Getting Started

To get Redrive working you need two applications running on two devices, one being the Redrive app that runs on your storage device, and the client app that can be used to connect to your Drive.

Firstly, install the Redrive server app by downloading it's installation file.

Once you got that setup you can install the client app on your android phones by downloading the apk file.
